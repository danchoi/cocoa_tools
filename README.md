# cocoa_tools

Just a place I will save the VimScript functions and Ruby scripts I want to
write from time to time to make Cocoa development a little more efficient.

## Install Ruby Gem

    gem install cocoa_tools


## Ruby commands


    cocoa strip-comments [files]

    e.g. cocoa strip-comment *.{h,m}

strips the comment clutter that gets generated by default at the top of your code files.



## Install VimScript

Copy scripts/cocoa_tools.vim to ~/.vim/scripts.

And then put this line in your .vimrc:

    autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.[mh] source ~/.vim/scripts/cocoa_tools.vim


## Vim Functions

`<leader><leader>` switches to alternate file (header to implementation or reverse). Assumes
alternate files are in the same directory.


More functions will be added from time to time.
